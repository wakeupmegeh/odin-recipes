        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>

        <p>Kimchi fried rice or 'kimchi bokkeumbap (김치볶음밥)' is a simple and beloved dish in Korea, often with the addition of some type of meat (my partner likes spam) or a fried egg, but just as easily made vegetarian or vegan.</p>

        <p>With a few simple ingredients and a bit of time, you'll be well on your way to creating a delicious and traditional Korean dish. This dish is easily tweaked to suit your tastes - for example, I like to add a bit of gochujang for extra spice.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Makes around 4 generous servings
            <ul>
            <li>vegetable oil</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
