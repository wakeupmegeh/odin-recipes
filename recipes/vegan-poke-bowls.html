        <p>I literally cannot fathom why these poke bowls are so good. To be perfectly honest, I don't know how 'authentic' these are or if they taste anything like traditional poke bowls, but they taste amazing.</p>

        <p>My partner likes to say 'these taste way better than they have any right to' and I have to agree. Easiest dinner we make by far, healthy and tasty AF.</p>

        <p>Enjoy</p>
