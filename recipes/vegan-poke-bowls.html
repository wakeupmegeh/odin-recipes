        <p><h3 class="main-text header">Description</h3></p>
        <p>I literally cannot fathom why these poke bowls are so good. To be perfectly honest, I don't know how 'authentic' these are or if they taste anything like traditional poke bowls, but they taste amazing.</p>

        <p>My partner likes to say 'these taste way better than they have any right to' and I have to agree. Easiest dinner we make by far, healthy and tasty AF.</p>

        <h3 class="main-text header">Ingredients</h3>

        <p> Makes enough for 2 depending on how big you like your portions (we like them big)

        <h3 class="main-text header">Steps</h3>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook rice - 1 part rice to 2 parts water with the stock cube and butter (if using) until all water is absorbed</li>
                <li>Cut tofu into small cubes and fry with whatever seasoning you like - I tend to use garlic powder, ginger powder, white pepper and chinese 5 spice with some soy sauce and mirin or rice vinegar</li>
                <li>Chop all the fruit and veggies up nice and small</li>
                <li>Place rice in a bowl and arrange fruit and veggies in a nice pretty circle on top as pictured above</li>
                <li>Top with siracha, sesame oil and soy sauce to taste (we use LOTS)</li>
                <li>Service with dried seaweed and enjoy!!</li>
            </ol>
