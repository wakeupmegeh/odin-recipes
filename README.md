This is a recipe website that I am creating to test what I've learned about HTML
Oh that's nice that it automatically went onto the next line instead of going on forever like in the Terminal Text Editor
I've just worked out how to connect GitHub and VS Code
I had connected it in the Terminal but I guess that's not enough?? 
This coding thing seems real easy then real hard
Git/GitHub is the real confusing thing 
We'll see how I feel shortly
I was going to date this but should I just do a Git commit thing?? 
I guess I'll do both
