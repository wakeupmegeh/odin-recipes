This is a recipe website that I am creating to test what I've learned about HTML  
Oh that's nice that it automatically went onto the next line instead of going on forever like in the Terminal Text Editor  
I've just worked out how to connect GitHub and VS Code  
I had connected it in the Terminal but I guess that's not enough??   
This coding thing seems real easy then real hard  
Git/GitHub is the real confusing thing   
We'll see how I feel shortly  
I was going to date this but should I just do a Git commit thing??   
I guess I'll do both  
I just realised that I can make a Terminal in VS Code and don't have to use the stupid shitty Terminal text editor for anything  
What a world  
And we have the clever bits on the side bar that let me stage and commit without actually typing the code for it   
But I guess I should continue to type the code for now to ---practice---  
And this little green bit at the side that shows me the new bits that    haven't been committed, that's very nice   
Anyway I'm rambling now -- time to make a real genuine website!  
Practicing Git commit messages here...   
Is this how you do a multi-line Git commit message..?   
Is this better??
